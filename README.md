# Tetrizz
My fourth attempt at creating a functional Tetrizz game! It proved to be the most challenging `JavaScript` project I've tackled so far! 

## Included with:

  - A fully functional Tetrizz game with features like public scoring, piece movement, dropping, rotation, custom settings, dark mode and much more!!
  - Local high scores and settings saving using the Web Storage API (localStorage).
  - Public high scores (top 10) build with `SQLite` and `fastify`, hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
    > Glitch is an awesome platform that has allowed me to learn backend development and share my projects with friends at no cost. They offer a generous allowance of 1000 hours per month for free!
  - And way more exciting features to come!
