# Tetris
My fourth attempt at creating a functional Tetris game! It proved to be the most challenging `JavaScript` project I've tackled so far! 

## Included with:

  - A fully functional Tetris game with features like scoring, piece movement, dropping, and rotation, and more.
  - Local high scores using the Web Storage API (localStorage).
  - Public high scores (top 10) build with `SQLite` and `fastify`, hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
    > Glitch is an awesome platform that has allowed me to learn backend development and share my projects with friends at no cost. They offer a generous allowance of 1000 hours per month for free!
  - And more exciting features to come!

## To-Do List:

  - Improve the styling, as it's not the most visually appealing at the moment :).
